# Questionaire Project

This project aims to create a web application using React.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The project focuses on providing a platform for managing and practicing questions related to various topics.

## Project Description

1. **List of Questions by Subject**: Users can view a list of questions categorized by subjects. Subjects can have subtopics, and subtopics can further have sub-subtopics.

2. **Add Questions**: Users can add questions and their answers to any subtopic under any topic.

3. **Practice Mode**: Users can practice questions in a randomized order. They can choose from four options for each question: Correct, Incorrect, Not Viewed, or Mark for Review. Additionally, users can view the answer to each question.

4. **Filter Questions**: Users can filter questions based on topics, subtopics, or sub-subtopics. They can also choose to view questions from all topics simultaneously.

5. **Order of Questions**: Users can choose between two options for the order of questions: Sequential or Random.

6. **Side Panel**: A side panel will display a minimap-like visualization of the question lists. Hovering over the panel will show a popup window displaying the entire list of questions.
